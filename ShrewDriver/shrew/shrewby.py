"""
Fun things you can do with task parameters:

Suppose you want to change the balance of S+ and S- trials.
By default, it's 50/50, since sMinusPresentations = [0,1].
If you wanted it to be, say, 75% S+ trials, you can set:
sMinusPresentations = [0, 0, 0, 1].

Bear in mind that, if the sequence type is a _RETRY, you may get several copies
of a rare trial in a row.

Now, suppose you set:
sMinusPresentations = [0,1]
sPlusOrientations = [0, 45]
sMinusOrientations = [100, 110, 120]
Each trial would have a 50% chance of being an S+ or an S-.
The S- trials could be any of [100, 110, 120], while the S+ trials could show either 0 or 45.
