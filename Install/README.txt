You will need the latest version of PsychoPy to run these scripts.
Download it from http://www.psychopy.org/

After installing PsychoPy, try out the scripts in the "demos" and "diagnostics" folders.

For many scripts, we need to talk to the Measurement Computing DAQ device (USB-1208FS). For that you need two things: the driver, and the python library that talks to the driver. 

The driver is called InstaCal. Install that first. It requires a restart. 

After that you'll need to install the Python Universal Library for Measurement Computing. Extract the zip file you find in here and follow the instructions inside.

Happy stimming!
